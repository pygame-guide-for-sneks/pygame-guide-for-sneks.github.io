    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        "Where can I learn how to use pygame?" - one of the 
        most commonly asked questions that I get. But I always struggle to 
        answer, I sometimes point them to the docs and examples, but that 
        isn't a comprehensive guide on building good pygame based applications.
        There are many other tutorials and guides I found, but I always 
        find something lacking, there are many comments we give and many nitpicks we have 
        - so much so that some of us gathered and decided to put all of them into a book.
        This book.
