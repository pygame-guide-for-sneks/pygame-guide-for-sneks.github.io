        <h2><a id="class-intro" class="js"></a>What Are Classes and Why Do We Care?</h2>
        <p>
            Python is an object oriented programming language, which means that everything in Python is an object. But that doesn't tell us what objects are.
            The word "object" here just means a collection of data and/or functionality. More specifically, any piece of data attached to a class is 
            called an "attribute". Attributes can be either variables or functions, but attributes that are functions have another common name: methods. Variable attributes
            can be called "instance variables" to distinguish them from methods, but when talking about classes with other Python programmers, it is generally
            accepted that "attribute" usually means a variable and "method" means a function. Now, why do they matter and how do they relate to classes? We'll get to that.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should be familiar with the built-in datatypes such as:
            <ul>
                <li><code>int</code></li>
                <li><code>float</code></li>
                <li><code>str</code></li>
                <li><code>list</code></li>
                <li><code>tuple</code></li>
                <li><code>dict</code></li>
            </ul>
            Each of these built-in datatypes is actually a class! When talking about objects and classes, there are 4 key terms
            that should be kept in mind. Those terms are "class", "type", "instance", and "object". So let's discuss what these terms mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            A "class" is ultimately just a container for some data and functionality. The key part to recognize about a "class"
            is that the "class" term usually specifically refers to the abstract container itself. So <code>int</code> is a class
            but <code>1</code> is not. <code>1</code> is what's called an <i>instance</i> of the <code>int</code> class. Note, however, 
            <code>int</code> behaves a bit differently than most classes you'll define for 
            your own use. But, you can explicitly instantiate <code>int</code> in a similar fashion to the way you'll be instantiating 
            your own classes. Just append <code>()</code> to the end of the class name to create an instance (so like 
            <code>int()</code> would return an <code>int</code> instance. You can also put any number into the parentheses and it 
            will create an instance based on that number, otherwise it defaults to 0).
        </p>
        <p>
            A "type" is pretty much another word for "class" in Python. The <code>type</code> function returns the class that the 
            argument is an instance of (if you print <code>type(1)</code> in Python, you'll get <code>int</code>). But wait, why did
            I say "pretty much another word for 'class'" and not "another word for class?" Well, that part is complicated and well
            beyond the scope of this guide. There is a link at the bottom of the page that goes into depth about the relationship
            between the two concepts in Python. I only mention that there is a difference for the pedants that might take issue with
            my simplification. So, you can ignore all but the first couple of sentences in this paragraph in 99.99999&percnt; of cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            An "object" is an instance of a class. <code>1</code> is an object. Here's how to think about class vs instance: A class is 
            a template for an instance. The class tells you how to construct whatever data structure you're trying to construct, and an
            instance is what you get when you follow the template. Again for the pedants: technically everything in python
            is an "object" too, but I'm still simplifying here.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="simple-class" class="js"></a>Creating a Simple Class</h2>
        <p>
            Now's the time that we can start actually making classes. So, let's start off by creating a very simple one. Here's a class definition that we will
            parse:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        print('bar')
{% endhighlight %}
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's talk about the <code>class Foo:</code> part first. This is where we create a class named "Foo". That's it.
            No more black magic here. We are literally just telling Python that we want to create a class called "Foo".
        </p>

        <p>
            Now for the next line, <code>def __init__(self):</code>. This is called the class <i>constructor</i>. Almost every class you'll ever write
            has this part. I'm leaving out a few details here since they are way out of scope of this discussion. This particular function is called the constructor
            because it, in essence, "constructs" the class. Generally, you don't want to put anything computationally expensive in the constructor nor do you want to
            call a computationally expensive function from the constructor. Its job is to just set up the instance in such a way that you can use it. The
            <code>self</code> parameter is always needed and will get passed in automatically when you instantiate the class. To create an instance of the
            above class, you essentially "call" it like you do a function (i.e. add the parentheses): <code>foo_instance = Foo()</code>. Most classes don't provide
            much functionality just by existing. You need an instance of the class. There are exceptions and we'll touch on 
            those, so let's continue.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now let's start building a class that we will continue to build on throughout this tutorial:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class Actor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
{% endhighlight %}

            But what if we want to have our player have some actual data? How do we do that? The answer is attributes. We can define class attributes that persist
            even when the constructor has finished and these attributes can be accessed from other places in your code. So, let's define a few attributes:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class Actor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.health = 100
        self.attack = 5
        self.defense = 0
        self.inventory = ['sword', 'shield']
{% endhighlight %}

            Alright, let's parse what we see here. When we create a <code>Actor</code> instance, the constructor is going to assign the values health, attack, defense, 
            and some inventory to something called <code>self</code>. The <code>self</code> parameter represents the <i>class instance</i> (or in other words, it's 
            <i>referring to itself</i>), so you're really just assigning those bits of data to the instance of the class. This serves a quite useful purpose. 
            You see, if I didn't prefix all of those with <code>self</code>, then when the constructor finished running the values would get garbage collected 
            away and would not exist anymore. That's not what we want at all. So, we assign them to be instance attributes as above and those values stay in 
            scope for as long as the instance itself exists. Another benefit is that we can change them for individual instances and the changes 
            only apply to that single instance and no others.
            Here's an example:

            <iframe width='800px' height='200px' class="python-embed" src="https://godbolt.org/e#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(filename:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:python,selection:(endColumn:1,endLineNumber:9,positionColumn:1,positionLineNumber:9,selectionStartColumn:1,selectionStartLineNumber:9,startColumn:1,startLineNumber:9),source:'class+NPC:%0A++++def+__init__(self):%0A++++++++self.health+%3D+100%0A++++++++self.attack+%3D+5%0A++++++++self.defense+%3D+0%0A++++++++self.inventory+%3D+%5B!'sword!',+!'shield!'%5D%0A++++++++potion_effects+%3D+%5B!'strength!',+!'swiftness!'%5D%0A%0A%0Anpc1+%3D+NPC()%0Anpc2+%3D+NPC()%0A%0Anpc1.defense+%3D+5%0Anpc2.attack+%3D+10%0A%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc1.health+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc1.attack+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc1.defense+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc1.inventory+%3D+%7D%22)%0A%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc2.health+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc2.attack+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc2.defense+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc2.inventory+%3D+%7D%22)%0A%0Aprint(f%22%7Bnpc1.potion_effects+%3D+%7D%22)'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Python+source+%231',t:'0')),k:50,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:executor,i:(argsPanelShown:'1',compilationPanelShown:'1',compiler:python310,compilerOutShown:'0',execArgs:'',execStdin:'',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:python,libs:!(),options:'',source:1,stdinPanelShown:'1',tree:'1',wrap:'1'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Executor+Python+3.10+(Python,+Editor+%231)',t:'0')),k:50,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4"></iframe>

            We can see that all of the attributes we prefixed with <code>self</code> printed just fine, but as soon as we tried to print the value that wasn't prefixed,
            we got an <code>AttributeError</code> which means that the attribute we tried to access does not exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            A general rule of thumb for whether something should be an attribute or not is this:
            <blockquote>
                Make it an attribute if you need it later and ONLY if you need it later
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Python variable and method names also have a few naming conventions (note that these are common conventions and are
            not enforced at all in Python). To read the full convention, see <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables" class="new-tab">PEP 8</a>:
            <ul>
                <li>No leading underscore</li>
                <li>Single leading underscore</li>
                <li>Double leading underscore</li>
                <li>Trailing underscore</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>No leading underscores</h3>
        <p>
            These are the simplest to understand. They're quite simply things like above: <code>self.health = 100</code>. There are no underscores at the beginning of
            the attribute name. The purpose of these attributes is that they are intended to be directly accessed and modified by the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Single leading underscores</h3>
        <p>
            These are a little more complicated to understand. A single leading underscore attribute would look like <code>self._health = 100</code>.
            The purpose of these attributes is that they are intended to be "protected". The user can still access these, but the leading underscore is the best
            indication to them that tinkering with this variable could break something because it's not intended to be modified directly. These attributes will
            be easily accessible under the same name in any subclasses (we will get to those, so be patient).
        </p>

        <h3>Double leading underscores</h3>
        <p>
            These are the trickiest to understand. One of these attributes would look like <br>
            <code>self.__health = 100</code>. These attributes are intended to be private; users are not supposed to access these nor are any subclasses.
            This doesn't make them inaccessible. They're actually harder to access. This is due to <b>name mangling</b>. When you define one of these
            attributes on a class, the name of the attribute is changed outside of the class itself. If my class name is <code>Actor</code> with the
            attribute I listed above, I'd have to access the attribute like <code>instance._Actor__health</code>, but within the <code>Actor</code> class,
            I could just call <code>self.__health</code>. We'll talk about the subclass implications after we talk about subclasses in the Inheritance section.
        </p>

        <h3>Trailing underscore</h3>
        <p>
            A common thing that beginners do is to name their attributes something like <code>type</code> or <code>id</code>. While this usually won't get
            you into trouble and it will usually work fine, this is still frowned upon because <code>type</code> and <code>id</code> have specific meanings in Python.
            The commonly accepted way to use names like these is to append an underscore to the end of the variable name, so instead of <code>self.id</code>,
            you should do <code>self.id_</code>. There is really no other purpose to a single trailing underscore in an attribute name, it's just a common way to
            prevent yourself from accidentally shadowing something else.

        <h2><a id="inheritance" class="js"></a>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes you want to create multiple classes that have the same basic functionality, but they each behave a bit differently. 
            An example relevant to pygame might be that you have NPCs, Enemies, and the Player. Each one is gonna have pretty much the same basic logic:
            <ol>
                <li>making the image</li>
                <li>scaling it to the appropriate size (actually, you should ideally make your images the correct size in the first place, but scale if needed)</li>
                <li>making sure that you have a way to position the character once it's time to draw it on screen</li>
            </ol>
            But maybe each one has different movement logic and possibly the same or different attack logic. It's always a pain to write the
            same piece of code over and over again. Also, if you change your mind, you'll have to remember every place you need to change 
            your code. This is a great example of how  something called subclassing can be useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's say I want to create NPC and Enemy classes. I might start off with defining an Actor class that doesn't have much functionality, but will serve
            as the base of my NPC and Enemy classes. That Actor class might be defined in this way:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class Actor:
    def __init__(self, position, image, size):
        self.image = image
        self.size = size
        self.pos = position
{% endhighlight %}

            Note that I've put a few more arguments into the constructor: <code>position</code>, <code>image</code>, and 
            <code>size</code>. These are bits of information that I would expect pretty much any character in the game to need.
            Now, I want to create an NPC class. I <i>could</i> rewrite all of that code in the constructor of
            my NPC class, but that's a lot of overhead as mentioned before. Instead, let's <b>subclass</b> <code>Actor</code>:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class NPC(Actor):
    def __init__(self, position, image, size, dialogue):
            self.dialogue = dialogue
{% endhighlight %}
            
            And that's all there is to it right? <b>Wrong.</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Python has no idea what our intentions are. It could assume that we want the constructor of <code>Actor</code> to be
            called immediately, but that's a lot of overhead and might not actually be what we want. So, we have to explicitly
            call the constructor of <code>Actor</code> (side note: Actor here is also known as the superclass of NPC, and that'll
            be important in a second). There are a couple of ways to do that: explicitly calling the constructor of <code>Actor</code>,
            or by calling the constructor of the superclass.
        </p>

        <p>
            Calling Actor's constructor:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class NPC(Actor):
    def __init__(self, position, image, size, dialogue):
        Actor.__init__(self, position, image, size)
        self.dialogue = dialogue
{% endhighlight %}

            Calling the superclass constructor:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class NPC(Actor):
    def __init__(self, position, image, size, dialogue):
        super().__init__(position, image, size)
        self.dialogue = dialogue
{% endhighlight %} 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            These look practically identical (and in fact, they practically do the exact same thing in simple cases), but there are a
            few reasons to choose one over the other. Generally, <code>super().__init__</code> is preferred because it's easy to swap
            out or rename the superclass if you need to, as well as not needing to remember the <code>self</code> parameter. And for
            longer class names, it's also shorter. But, the situation where you would possibly want to use <code>Actor.__init__</code>
            would be in the case of more complicated inheritance structures (long chains of inheritance or multiple inheritance,
            both of which are well outside the scope of this article and game design in general, but a link is at the bottom of the
            page for an excellent video on the topic from the 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mCodingWithJamesMurphy" class="new-tab">mCoding</a> YouTube channel).
        </p>

        <p>
            The power of class inheritance is that attributes are <i>inherited</i> from the superclass to the subclass. So, an instance of
            <code>NPC</code> as given above has the same attributes as <code>Actor</code> (note that this would not be the case if we had
            not called the constructor of the superclass). Here's an example to play around with:
            
            <iframe width='800px' height='200px' class="python-embed" src="https://godbolt.org/e#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(filename:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:python,selection:(endColumn:13,endLineNumber:15,positionColumn:13,positionLineNumber:15,selectionStartColumn:13,selectionStartLineNumber:15,startColumn:13,startLineNumber:15),source:'class+Actor:%0A++++def+__init__(self,+position,+image,+size):%0A++++++++self.image+%3D+image%0A++++++++self.size+%3D+size%0A++++++++self.pos+%3D+position%0A++++%0A++++def+talk(self,+text):%0A++++++++print(text)%0A%0A%0Aclass+NPC(Actor):%0A++++def+__init__(self,+position,+image,+size,+dialogue):%0A++++++++++++super().__init__(position,+image,+size)%0A++++++++++++self.dialogue+%3D+dialogue%0A++++++++++++%0A++++%0Anpc+%3D+NPC((100,+200),+%22assets/npc.png%22,+(20,+20),+%22Hello+World!!%22)%0Aprint(npc.pos)%0Aprint(npc.dialogue)%0Anpc.talk(%22Hello%22)'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Python+source+%231',t:'0')),k:50,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:executor,i:(argsPanelShown:'1',compilationPanelShown:'0',compiler:python310,compilerOutShown:'0',execArgs:'',execStdin:'',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:python,libs:!(),options:'',source:1,stdinPanelShown:'1',tree:'1',wrap:'1'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Executor+Python+3.10+(Python,+Editor+%231)',t:'0')),k:50,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4"></iframe>
            But remember from the beginning what I said about attributes and methods? I said that methods <b>are</b> attributes, so 
            anything that applies to variable attributes also applies to methods! This means that methods are inherited too. Try it
            in the embed above. Define a method of the <code>Actor</code> class and try to call it from the instance of <code>NPC</code>.
            One example of that might look like:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class Actor:
    def __init__(self, position, image, size):
        self.image = image
        self.size = size
        self.pos = position
    
    def talk(self, text):
        print(text)


class NPC(Actor):
    def __init__(self, position, image, size, dialogue):
        super().__init__(position, image, size)
        self.dialogue = dialogue


npc = NPC("Tom", "assets/tom.png")
print(npc.name)
print(npc.image)
npc.talk("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}
        </p>
            
        <p>
            But there's more that we can do! <code>super().__init__()</code> in the constructor of a subclass hints that we can access
            the methods of the superclass in the subclass! In fact, this is one of the most powerful aspects of inheritance! Let's say
            my <code>Actor</code> superclass has a method <code>func</code> and I want to run that method in my <code>NPC</code> subclass
            but I also want it to do some additional stuff. One option would be to copy/paste the code from <code>Actor.func</code> into 
            <code>NPC.func</code>. But there's an alternative that is easier to maintain and reduces the amount of duplicate code: call 
            <code>super().func()</code> in <code>NPC.func</code>, like so:

{% highlight python linenos %}
class Actor:
    def __init__(self, position, image, size):
        self.image = image
        self.size = size
        self.pos = position
    
    def talk(self, text):
        print(text)


class NPC(Actor):
    def __init__(self, position, image, size, dialogue):
        super().__init__(position, image, size)
        self.dialogue = dialogue
    
    def talk(self, player_text, npc_text):
        print(f"You said {player_text}")
        super().talk(npc_text)

    
npc = NPC((100, 200), "assets/npc.png", (20, 20), "Hello World!")
print(npc.pos)
print(npc.dialogue)
npc.talk("Hello", "Hello there")
{% endhighlight %}
