            <!-- TODO: reword part about attributes and methods-->
            Python is an object oriented programming language, which means that
            everything in Python is an object. But that doesn't tell us what objects are.
            The word "object" here just means a collection of data and/or
            functionality. More
            specifically, objects contain two types of structures: attributes
            and methods.
            Generally speaking, attributes are variables and methods are
            functions. Now, why do they
            matter and how do they relate to classes? We'll get to that.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should be familiar with the built-in datatypes such as:
            <ul>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>float</li>
                <li>str</li>
                <li>list</li>
                <li>tuple</li>
                <li>dict</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these built-in datatypes is actually an object! If you don't
            believe me, here is
            proof:

            Wait, what? What the heck does <code>&ltclass 'type'></code> mean? 
            <br>
            <b>Weeeeelllllll</b>...
            <br>
            that's a very long story <i>far</i> out of the scope of this
            discussion. There will be some references at the bottom of the page
            that you can reference
            if you dare to dig into it. The important part of the answer is that
            classes are both objects and types while instances of classes are
            only objects.
            So from now on whenever the terms "object", "class", and "type" are
            being used when talking about Python, they're <i>probably</i>
            interchangeable.
            The ultimate answer to "What is a class" is that it is a container
            for some data and
            functionality.

        <h2><a id="simple-class" class="js"></a>Creating a Simple Class</h1>
        <p>
            Now's the time that we can start actually making classes. So, let's
            start off by
            creating a very simple one. Here's a class definition that we will
            parse:

{% highlight python %}
    class Foo:
        def __init__(self):
            print('bar')
{% endhighlight %}
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's talk about the <code>class Foo:</code> part first. This is where we create a class named "Foo". That's it.
            No more black magic here. We are literally just telling Python that we want to create a class called "Foo".
        </p>

        <p>
            Now for the next line, <code>def __init__(self):</code>. This is called the class <i>constructor</i>. Almost every class you'll ever write
            has this part. I'm leaving out a few details here since they are way out of scope of this discussion. This particular function is called the constructor
            because it, in essence, "constructs" the class. Generally, you don't want to put anything computationally expensive in the constructor nor do you want to
            call a computationally expensive function from the constructor. It's job is to just set up the instance in such a way that you can use it. The 
            <code>self</code> parameter is always needed and will get passed in automatically when you instantiate the class (note that you do not need 
            to call it <code>self</code>, but that's the common convention and you'll confuse a lot of people if you don't). To create an instance of the
            above class, you essentially "call" it like you do a function: <code>foo_instance = Foo()</code>. Generally, classes are abstract things that
            have little or no functionality on their own. You need an instance of the class. There are exceptions and we'll touch on those, so let's continue.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now let's start building a class that we will continue to build on
            throughout this
            tutorial:

{% highlight python %}
class Actor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass {% endhighlight %}

            But what if we want to have our player have some actual data? How do we do that? The answer is attributes. We can define class attributes that persist even when the
            constructor has finished and these attributes can be accessed from other places in your code. So, let's define a few attributes:

{% highlight python %}
class Actor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.health = 100
        self.attack = 5
        self.defense = 0
        self.inventory = ['sword', 'shield']
{% endhighlight %}

            Alright, let's parse what we see here. When we create a <code>Actor</code> instance, the constructor is going to assign the values
            health, attack, defense, and some inventory to something called <code>self</code>. <code>self</code>
            represents the <i>class instance</i> (or in other words, it's <i>referring to itself</i>), so you're really just assigning those bits of data
            to the instance of the class. This serves a quite useful purpose. You see, if I didn't prefix all of those with <code>self</code>,
            then when the constructor finished running then the values would go out of the local scope they were defined in and get garbage collected away
            and would not exist anymore. That's not what we want at all. So, we assign them to be instance attributes as above and those values stay in scope
            for as long as the instance itself stays in scope. Another benefit is that we can change them for individual instances and the changes only apply
            to that single instance and no others. Here's an example:
            
            <iframe width="800px" height="200px" class="python-embed"
                src="https://godbolt.org/e#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(filename:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:python,source:'class+Player:%0A++++def+__init__(self):%0A++++++++self.health+%3D+100%0A++++++++self.attack+%3D+5%0A++++++++self.defense+%3D+0%0A++++++++self.inventory+%3D+%5B!'sword!',+!'shield!'%5D%0A++++++++potion_effects+%3D+%5B!'strength!',+!'swiftness!'%5D%0A%0Aplayer+%3D+Player()%0Aprint(f%22%7Bplayer.health+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bplayer.attack+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bplayer.defense+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bplayer.inventory+%3D+%7D%22)%0Aprint(f%22%7Bplayer.potion_effects+%3D+%7D%22)'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Python+source+%231',t:'0')),k:50,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:executor,i:(argsPanelShown:'1',compilationPanelShown:'1',compiler:python310,compilerOutShown:'0',execArgs:'',execStdin:'',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:python,libs:!(),options:'',source:1,stdinPanelShown:'1',tree:'1',wrap:'1'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Executor+Python+3.10+(Python,+Editor+%231)',t:'0')),k:50,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4"></iframe>
            We can see that all of the attributes we prefixed with <code>self</code>
            printed just fine, but as soon as we tried to print the
            value that wasn't prefixed, we got an <code>AttributeError</code>
            which
            means that the attribute we tried to access does not exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            A general rule of thumb for whether something should be an attribute
            or not is this:
            <blockquote>
                Make it an attribute if you need it later and ONLY if you need
                it later
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
            Attributes also have a few naming conventions (note that these are
            common conventions
            and are not enforced at all in Python):
            <ul>
                <li>No leading underscore</li>
                <li>Single leading underscore</li>
                <li>Double leading underscore</li>
                <li>Trailing underscore</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>No leading underscores</h3>
        <p>
            These are the simplest to understand. They're quite simply things like above: <code>self.health = 100</code>. There are no underscores
            at the beginning of the attribute name. The purpose of these attributes is that they are intended to be directly accessed and modified by the user.
        </p>

        <h3>Single leading underscores</h3>
        <p>
            These are a little more complicated to understand. A single leading underscore attribute would look like <code>self._health = 100</code>.
            The purpose of these attributes is that they are intended to be "protected". The user can still access these, but the leading underscore is the best
            indication to them that tinkering with this variable could break something because it's not intended to be modified directly. These attributes will
            be easily accessible under the same name in any subclasses (we will get to those, so be patient).
        </p>

        <h3>Double leading underscores</h3>
        <p>
            These are the trickiest to understand. One of these attributes would look like <br>
            <code>self.__health = 100</code>. These attributes are
            intended to be private; users are not supposed to access these nor are any subclasses. This doesn't make them inaccessible. They're actually harder to access.
            This is due to <b>name mangling</b>. When you define one of these attributes on a class, the name of the attribute is changed outside of the class itself.
            If my class name is <code>Actor</code> with the attribute I listed above, I'd have to access the attribute like <code>instance._Actor__health</code>,
            but within the <code>Actor</code> class, I could just call <code>self.__health</code>. We'll talk about the subclass implications after we talk about
            subclasses in the Inheritance section.
