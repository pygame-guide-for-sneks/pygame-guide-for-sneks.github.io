    <h2><a id="what-is-pygame" class="js"></a>What is pygame?</h2>
    <p>
        Before we get into the nitty gritty parts of it, let us first understand what pygame is.
        pygame is a free and open source library for the Python programming language, which allows 
        us to build multimedia applications such as video games.

    <p>
        pygame provides the very basic utility to draw and manipulate pixels 
        on to the screen, much like SDL2, but with extended utility in various forms 
        that makes it easier to use. pygame gives you direct control over how you 
        want the code to run, this means you could also easily do things that could 
        drastically drop performance if you aren't careful. This article guides you 
        through how to avoid such things, while also giving you deeper 
        understanding of pygame and how to use it.         
    </p>

    <h2><a id="prerequisites" class="js"></a>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
        As pygame is a library for <i>python</i>, it is necessary that you 
        are familiar with it. This goes beyond the scope of this book, but 
        there are some other great resources for learning Python itself, such  
        as <a href="">automate the boring stuff</a>.
        
        Now, luckily you don't have to be an Anthony Shaw or Tim Peters to be
        able to use pygame, just some basic Python will do. 
        This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding how types and instances work</li>
                <li>Knowing how to access and modify attributes of objects</li>
                <li>Familiarity with basic OOP(Object Oriented Programming)</li>
                <li>Basic control flow keywords such as - for, while, break, if, elif, else</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
            </ul>
        
        Since in Python everything is an object, that is also how you would 
        interact with the utilities provided through pygame, so knowing how they work 
        is crucial.

    <h2><a id="installation" class="js"></a>Installing pygame</h2>
    <p>
        pygame can be installed through <a href="https://pypi.org">pypi</a> by
        using the pip package manager.

        This is as simple as,
    </p>

    <p>
{% highlight python %}
pip install pygame
{% endhighlight %}

    BUT, how you access your pip depends on your Operating System and what interpreter 
    you plan on using to run the code you will be writing throughout this article. 

    For the sake of this article, we recommend installing pygame globally, and using your global interpreter 
    to run your code. 
    
    For windows, the way you access pip can be 


{% highlight python %}
pip install pygame 
# Or

# Accessing pip as a module through your python launcher
py -m pip install pygame 

python -m pip install pygame
{% endhighlight %}

    If you aren't too confident with where pygame is being installed, use your python launcher 
    as shown in the last 2 methods to install it, and use the same launcher to run the code accordingly!
