    <h2><a id="what-is-pygame" class="js"></a>What is pygame?</h2>
    <p>
        Before we get into the nitty gritty parts of it, let us first understand what pygame is.
        pygame is a free and open source library for the Python programming language, which allows 
        us to build multimedia applications such as video games.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        pygame provides the very basic utility to draw and manipulate pixels 
        on to the screen, much like SDL2, but with extended utility in various forms 
        that makes it easier to use. pygame gives you direct control over how you 
        want the code to run, this means you could also easily do things that could 
        drastically drop performance if you aren't careful. This article guides you 
        through how to avoid such things, while also giving you deeper 
        understanding of pygame and how to use it.         
    </p>

    <h2><a id="prerequisites" class="js"></a>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
        As pygame is a library for <i>python</i>, it is necessary that you 
        are familiar with Python itself. This goes beyond the scope of this book, but 
        there are some other great resources for learning Python, such  
        as <a href="">automate the boring stuff</a>.
        
        Now, luckily you don't have to be an Anthony Shaw or Tim Peters to be
        able to use pygame, just some basic Python will do. 
        This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding how types and instances work</li>
                <li>Knowing how to access and modify attributes of objects</li>
                <li>Familiarity with basic OOP(Object Oriented Programming)</li>
                <li>Basic control flow keywords such as - for, while, break, if, elif, else</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
            </ul>
        
        Since in Python everything is an object, that is also how you would 
        interact with the utilities provided through pygame, so knowing how they work 
        is crucial.

    <h2><a id="installation" class="js"></a>Installing pygame</h2>
    <p>
        pygame can be installed through <a href="https://pypi.org">pypi</a> by
        using the pip package manager.

        This is as simple as,
    </p>

    <p>
{% highlight python %}
pip install pygame
{% endhighlight %}

    BUT, how you access your pip depends on your Operating System and what interpreter 
    you plan on using to run the code you will be writing throughout this article. 

    For the sake of this article, we recommend installing pygame globally, and using your global interpreter 
    to run your code. 
    
    For windows, the way you access pip can be 


{% highlight python %}
pip install pygame 
# Or

# Accessing pip as a module through your python launcher
py -m pip install pygame 

python -m pip install pygame
{% endhighlight %}

    If you aren't too confident with where pygame is being installed, use your python launcher 
    as shown in the last 2 methods to install it, and use the same launcher to run the code accordingly!

    </p>

    <h2><a id="project-directory" class="js"></a>Setting up the project directory</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout this whole miniseries, you will be required to work with a couple different 
        files, it would be better and recommended if everything required to run your game is within 
        one directory. We will create the required folders as we go, rather than take the generic 
        approach and dump everything into our project folder that we wouldn't need(yet). But, 
        we do still need some basic setup.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, create a folder whereever you would like, and name it whatever you want. I will be
        naming it <b>pygame_platformer</b> and I will store it in my <b>d:\dev\projects\</b> directory.
        Once you have your project directory created, make a <b>main.py</b> file. This is where 
        the code for our game will be! For now that is enough. If you check the contents of your project
        folder, it should look like this:
{% highlight python %}
PS D:\dev\projects\pygame_platformer> ls


    Directory: D:\dev\projects\pygame_platformer


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----        11-08-2022     22:09              0 main.py


{% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <h2><a id="opening-a-window" class="js"></a>Opening a window with pygame</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, we get into the actual code! Time to write the most legendary line 
        at the top of our <b>main.py</b> file, 

{% highlight python %}
import pygame
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <p>
        Alright, now recall the part where I mention you should run all code through 
        the same launcher to which pygame was installed. For this, the safest bet is opening 
        up the same terminal application, and using your respective python launcher to run 
        <b>main.py</b>. For me, this is <i>py</i>  as I am on windows.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your output should look like this:
{% highlight python %}
PS D:\dev\projects\pygame_platformer> py main.py
pygame 2.1.2 (SDL 2.0.18, Python 3.10.4)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.htm
{% endhighlight %}

        If your code runs fine and you get the desired output, congrats! ðŸŽ‰ You just installed 
        pygame successfully on your system!

        The Python version is to be noted, we will be using <b>3.10.4</b> in this article,
        the pygame version will be <b>2.1.2</b>, but pygame takes backward compatibility 
        seriously, and most older version code would work on newer verions too, and 
        we wouldn't be introducing any of the newer features in this article. As of now 
        2.1.2 is the latest stable release of pygame. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Next up, after importing pygame, the first thing you do is to <i>always</i> initialize 
        the module. If you don't do this step it can lead to problems later on, this initializes 
        many submodules such as pygame.font, pygame.mixer, etc. which we will cover in detail later.
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <p>
        Now let's actually open up a window, for this, we will look at the
         <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.set_mode">pygame.display.set_mode</a> function. 
        This allows us to initialize the window, and it returns a pygame.Surface when called. A 
        pygame.Surface is a data type which allows us to manipulate and draw pixels on it, this special 
        surface is directly linked to what shows up on the window, so everything we want to appear 
        on the window should be drawn on this special surface first. For now, let us look at what we need in 
        order to call pygame.display.set_mode

{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()


WIN_SIZE = (420, 250)
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(WIN_SIZE)
{% endhighlight %}

        Notice that we passed in a tuple containing two integers, the first integer is the <i>width</i> 
        of the window we want to create, and the second is the <i>height</i> of the window. This fills in the size 
        parameter which is the only required argument to call this function.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you run this code, the window opens up and then closes immediately. Why is that? 
        This is because there is nothing telling pygame that the window is alive, nor is the 
        python program continuing to run. After creating that special surface we were talking about 
        it just closes. 
    </p>
